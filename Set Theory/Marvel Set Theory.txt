Use of Characters in cards
------------------------------------
Since the MCU has so many story beats where Heroes and villians 
go back and forth between good and bad and are span multiple films,
each character will have multiple cards to help depict each part of
the MCU more accurately as well as help expand the card pool.

There can still be sets of cards that perhaps break out of individual movies
like a cycle of Infinity Stones, but each film will generally have 6-10 cards
depicting the story and capturing the essence of the characters at that time.
